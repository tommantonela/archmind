ADR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE_ZEROSHOT

"""The context below describes the main characteristics and 
    operating enviroment for a software system that needs to be developed. 
    As part of the context, there is also a list of requirements that this software system must fulfill.
    I made a main design decision that addresses all the requirements. 
    I might also have an assesment covering several aspects of the decision.
    I might also include an ordered list of design alternatives for the main decision. The main decision is often at the top of this list.

    Based on all this information, please specify an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for me.
    The ADR template includes the following sections: 'title', 'motivation', 'decision drivers', 'main decision', 
    'alternative decisions' considered, and 'pros' and 'cons' of all the decisions.
    For writing the sections of the ADR, think step by step and use the following rules:
    1. The 'title' section should be short and descriptive of the purpose of the main design decision.
    2. The 'motivation' section should explain the problem being solved by the decision. Both the system context and 
    the requirements above should be blended in the motivation. Do not use bullets for this section.
    3. The 'decision drivers' section should simply list all the given requirements.
    4. The 'main decision' section should present the design decision chosen and explain how it addresses the requirements.
    Additional information from the assessment about clarifying questions, assumptions and follow-up decisions can
    also be included in this section, but integrated into the text. Do not use bullets for this section.
    5. The 'alternatives' section should list any other design decisions that could address the requirements in the system context
    provided, but were not chosen. If an ordered list of design alternatives is included below, please use only those alternatives 
    for this section and describe them briefly. If the ordered list is not included, leave the 'alternatives' section empty.
    6. The 'pros' section should list the advantages of each of the decisions (both main decision and design alternatives). 
    Please organize the advantages according to each of the decisions.
    7. The 'cons' section should list the disadvantages of each of the decisions (both main decision and design alternatives). 
    Please organize the disadvantages according to each of the decisions.
    Information from the assessment below can be used to inform the 'pros' and 'cons' for the main decision.

    Focus on addressing the specific requirements with the decision, rather than on the general use cases for the decision.
    Return your answer in Markdown format considering the different sections of the ADR template.
    Carefully check my design decision and do not admit dubious or unknown decisions. 
    If the decisions are dubious or unknown just state the reasons, don't make the ADR up.
    If everything is Ok, then only return the sections of the ADR and nothing else.
