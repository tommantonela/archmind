"""The context below describes the main characteristics and operating enviroment
    for a software system that needs to be developed. There is also a list of requirements that this software system must fulfill. 
    For these requirements, I made a main design decision to intends to address all of them. 
    My main decision is enclosed by backticks below.
    There are also additional decisions either addressing my requirements or other requirements of the system.
    
    I want to check the overall consistency of my main decision with the related additional decisions.
    Any of the decisions above can be expressed as a well-known design pattern, or an architectural style, or an 
    architectural tactic, or a design principle.
    
    Report any conflict or inconsistency between the main decision and any of the additional decisions.
    Focus on addressing the specific requirements, rather than on the general use cases for the decisions.
    Return your answer in plain text with bullets for the key points of your analysis.
    Carefully check my main decision and do not admit dubious or unknown decisions. 
    If my main decision is dubious or unknown just say so and don't perform any consistency analysis.
    If my decision does not make sense for the context or is not appropriate for the requirements, just state what the problem is.
