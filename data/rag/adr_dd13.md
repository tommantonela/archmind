# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Pattern with Gateway Component for Transitioning to Microservices Architecture

## Motivation
The food company aims to transition from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. This transition involves replacing current access methods with HTTP/REST protocols through a Gateway component to provide a centralized access point for clients. Additionally, the application needs to support both PC and mobile platforms.

## Decision Drivers
1. Migrate from monolithic architecture to microservices.
2. Implement a Gateway component for managing HTTP/REST requests.
3. Support application functionality on both PC and mobile.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to adopt the Microservices Pattern with a Gateway Component. This decision aligns with the goal of transitioning to a microservices architecture by decomposing the application into smaller, independent services. The Microservices Pattern allows for independent development and scalability, while the Gateway Component manages HTTP/REST requests, providing a centralized access point for clients. This approach addresses the requirements of migrating to microservices, implementing a Gateway component, and supporting both PC and mobile platforms.

The decision to use the Microservices Pattern with a Gateway Component enables:
- Scalability: Each service can be independently scaled.
- Flexibility: Services can be developed and deployed independently.
- Centralized Access: Gateway component provides a single entry point for clients.
- Independent Development: Services can evolve separately, enhancing agility.

## Alternatives
N/A

## Pros
- Scalability: Each service can be independently scaled.
- Flexibility: Services can be developed and deployed independently.
- Centralized Access: Gateway component provides a single entry point for clients.
- Independent Development: Services can evolve separately, enhancing agility.

## Cons
- Complexity: Managing a distributed system can be complex and require additional infrastructure.
- Communication Overhead: Inter-service communication can introduce latency and complexity.
