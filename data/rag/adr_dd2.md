### Architecture Decision Record

**Title:** Implementation of Retry Pattern for Order Management Module

**Motivation:** The current system transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices architecture requires a reliable approach to manage customer orders. The system must ensure that clients have a limited number of attempts to place an order, enhancing the overall reliability of the order management module.

**Decision Drivers:**
1. The system must provide a module to manage customer orders.
2. Clients must have a maximum number of attempts to place an order.

**Main Decision:** The chosen pattern to address the requirements is the Retry Pattern. By implementing the Retry Pattern, the system can handle retrying failed requests for placing orders within a maximum number of attempts. This decision directly aligns with the need to ensure clients have a limited number of attempts to place an order, thereby improving the reliability of the order management module.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Service-oriented architecture pattern:**
   - *Pros:* Promotes reusability of services, easier maintenance of individual services, supports multiple communication protocols.
   - *Cons:* Tight coupling between services, potential performance issues, complex deployment.
   
2. **Microservices pattern:**
   - *Pros:* Scalability, flexibility, independent deployment of services, resilience to failures.
   - *Cons:* Increased complexity in managing distributed systems, challenges in inter-service communication, data consistency issues.

**Pros:**
- **Retry Pattern:** Ensures limited attempts for placing orders, improves reliability.
- **Service-oriented architecture pattern:** Promotes service reusability and easier maintenance.
- **Microservices pattern:** Enhances scalability, flexibility, and resilience.

**Cons:**
- **Retry Pattern:** May introduce complexity in retry logic implementation.
- **Service-oriented architecture pattern:** Tight coupling between services, potential performance issues.
- **Microservices pattern:** Increased complexity in managing distributed systems, challenges in data consistency.

This ADR outlines the decision to implement the Retry Pattern for the order management module, addressing the specific requirements of managing customer orders with limited placement attempts.
