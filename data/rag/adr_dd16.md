# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Adopting the Microservices Pattern for System Architecture

## Motivation
The food company is transitioning from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, flexibility, and maintenance. The system must allow access to client data and order data efficiently. By decomposing the system into smaller, independent services, the Microservices Pattern aligns with the company's plan and addresses the need for better management of client and order data within the microservices architecture.

## Decision Drivers
1. The system must allow access to client data.
2. The system must allow access to order data.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to adopt the Microservices Pattern for the system architecture. By decomposing the system into smaller, independent services, each handling specific functionalities like client data and order data, the Microservices Pattern allows for better scalability, flexibility, and maintenance of the system. The OrderManager component can be implemented as a microservice to facilitate communication between different functionalities while efficiently managing access to client and order data within the microservices architecture.

## Alternatives
1. API Gateway pattern: Enhances security and simplifies client access but introduces a single point of failure and potential performance bottleneck.
2. HTTP/REST pattern: Utilizes HTTP methods and REST principles for communication but may lead to limited functionality and potential overuse of HTTP methods.
3. Microservices Architecture pattern: Offers scalability and resilience but comes with increased complexity and operational overhead.

## Pros
- **Microservices Pattern**: Scalability, flexibility, technology diversity.
- **API Gateway pattern**: Enhances security, simplifies client access, enables protocol translation.
- **HTTP/REST pattern**: Stateless communication, cacheability, uniform interfaces.
- **Microservices Architecture pattern**: Scalability, resilience, technology independence.

## Cons
- **Microservices Pattern**: Complexity in managing distributed systems, increased network communication.
- **API Gateway pattern**: Single point of failure, potential performance bottleneck.
- **HTTP/REST pattern**: Limited functionality, potential overuse of HTTP methods.
- **Microservices Architecture pattern**: Increased complexity, operational overhead.

This ADR is based on the specific requirements of the system and the assessment provided, focusing on the need for efficient access to client and order data within a microservices architecture.
