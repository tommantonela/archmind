# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Architecture for Statistics Module

## Motivation
The food company is transitioning from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, fault isolation, and technology diversity. The system must include a module to provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers. By adopting the Microservices Architecture pattern, we can create a dedicated Statistics service that can independently provide statistics on these domains, ensuring efficient data retrieval and processing.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must include a module to provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers.

## Main Decision
The main decision is to implement the Microservices Architecture pattern. This decision allows for the creation of a dedicated Statistics service that can provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers independently. Each microservice can focus on a specific domain, enabling efficient data retrieval and processing for statistics generation. This approach aligns with the company's transition to a microservices architecture and ensures that the statistics module can operate independently and efficiently.

## Alternatives
1. HTTP/REST API pattern: Utilizes HTTP and REST principles for communication between components. This pattern was not chosen as it would not provide the necessary level of independence and scalability required for the statistics module.

## Pros
### Microservices Architecture
- Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand.
- Fault isolation: Issues in one microservice do not affect others, improving system reliability.
- Technology diversity: Different microservices can use technologies best suited for their specific tasks.
- Independent deployment: Each microservice can be deployed independently, reducing downtime for the entire system.

### HTTP/REST API pattern
- Standardized communication: Utilizes widely adopted standards for communication.
- Stateless interactions: Enhances system reliability and simplifies scaling.
- Wide adoption: HTTP/REST APIs are well-known and widely used in the industry.

## Cons
### Microservices Architecture
- Complexity: Managing multiple microservices can introduce complexity in deployment and monitoring.
- Increased network communication: Communication between microservices over the network can introduce latency.
- Data consistency challenges: Ensuring data consistency across microservices can be challenging.

### HTTP/REST API pattern
- Limited functionality: May not provide the necessary level of independence and scalability for complex modules.
- Potential performance overhead: RESTful interactions may introduce performance overhead compared to direct method calls in a monolithic system.
