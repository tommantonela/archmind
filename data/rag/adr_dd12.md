# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Utilizing the API Gateway Pattern for External Component Communication

## Motivation
The food company is transitioning to a microservices architecture and requires a solution for external components, specifically for payments, to communicate with the system through a dedicated API. The API Gateway Pattern is chosen to centralize external service communication, enforce security, simplify client access, and provide centralized logging and monitoring.

## Decision Drivers
- The payment must be made with an external component, which must communicate with the system through a dedicated API.

## Main Decision
The main decision is to implement the API Gateway Pattern to facilitate communication between the external payment component and the microservices. The API Gateway will serve as a centralized entry point for external communication, enabling secure routing to appropriate services, supporting API composition, and facilitating protocol translation. This decision aligns well with the requirement for an external component to communicate through a dedicated API.

The API Gateway will handle communication between the third-party payment component and the microservices by routing requests, enforcing security measures such as authentication and authorization, and providing logging and monitoring capabilities. Assumptions include effective routing and management by the API Gateway, with constraints on thorough API documentation and potential performance overhead. Quality attributes such as security and scalability will be enhanced, but risks of performance bottlenecks and trade-offs in complexity management exist.

## Alternatives
N/A

## Pros
- Centralized entry point for external communication
- Enables secure routing to appropriate services
- Supports API composition for invoking multiple services
- Facilitates protocol translation
- Enhances security through centralized authentication and authorization
- Improves scalability by offloading common functionalities like rate limiting and caching

## Cons
- Adds complexity to the system architecture
- Potential single point of failure if not properly designed and implemented
- Risks of performance bottlenecks if not optimized
- Trade-offs in managing and maintaining the gateway versus security and scalability benefits
