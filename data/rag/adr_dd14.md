# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Microservices Architecture for Payments Management

## Motivation
The food company needs to transition from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to enhance modularity, scalability, and independence of services. The system must provide a dedicated module to manage payments efficiently.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must provide a module to manage payments.

## Main Decision
The chosen decision is to implement the Microservices Architecture pattern. This pattern allows for the creation of a dedicated Payments service within the microservices ecosystem. By structuring the system as a set of services, each running independently and communicating through lightweight mechanisms, the Payments service can handle all payment-related functionalities autonomously. This approach ensures modularity, scalability, and independence of the Payments service. Additionally, the OrderManager component can seamlessly communicate with the Payments service as part of the overall microservices architecture.

## Alternatives
1. **Service-oriented architecture (SOA) pattern**
   - *Pros*: Reusability of services, interoperability across different applications.
   - *Cons*: Centralization leading to a single point of failure, potential performance issues due to centralized communication.

## Pros
### Microservices Architecture
- Scalability: Allows independent scaling of services.
- Resilience: Failure in one service does not affect others.
- Flexibility: Easier to update and deploy individual services.

### Service-oriented architecture (SOA) pattern
- Reusability: Services can be reused across different applications.
- Interoperability: Services can communicate with each other regardless of the platform or technology used.

## Cons
### Microservices Architecture
- Complexity: Managing multiple services can be complex.
- Communication Overhead: Inter-service communication can introduce latency and overhead.

### Service-oriented architecture (SOA) pattern
- Centralization: Can lead to a single point of failure.
- Performance: Services may have performance issues due to centralized communication.
