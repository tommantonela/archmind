# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Microservices Architecture for Managing Client Personal Data and Orders

## Motivation
The company is transitioning from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. The system needs to manage client personal data, order data, and order processing efficiently. By adopting the Microservices pattern, the system can decompose into smaller, independent services, aligning with the company's plan and fulfilling the specified requirements effectively.

## Decision Drivers
1. Manage client personal data
2. Access to order data
3. Create, modify, update, and process orders

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement a Microservices architecture. By decomposing the system into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., Customers, Orders), the system can effectively manage client personal data, order data, and order processing. This approach aligns with the company's transition plan and enables the system to fulfill all specified requirements efficiently.

The Microservices pattern allows for the creation of dedicated services for managing client personal data, order data, and order processing. This separation of concerns ensures that each service can focus on its specific functionality, leading to better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. Additionally, the use of well-defined APIs for communication between services facilitates easy integration and future expansion.

## Alternatives
1. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern
2. RESTful API pattern
3. Database per Service pattern
4. Event Sourcing pattern
5. Microservices Architecture pattern
6. Command Pattern

## Pros
### Microservices Architecture
1. Scalability by independently scaling services.
2. Flexibility in technology choices for each service.

## Cons
### Microservices Architecture
1. Increased network communication overhead.
2. Complexity in managing distributed systems.

## Assessment
The Microservices pattern was chosen over alternatives like CQRS, RESTful API, and others due to its alignment with the company's transition plan and its ability to effectively manage client personal data, order data, and order processing. While other patterns offer specific advantages like improved performance or data isolation, the Microservices architecture provides a comprehensive solution for the given requirements and the system context.
