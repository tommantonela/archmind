### Architecture Decision Record

**Title:** Selection of Gateway Pattern for HTTP/REST Requests Management

**Motivation:** The transition to a microservices architecture necessitates the implementation of a Gateway component to manage HTTP/REST requests efficiently. The Gateway Pattern provides a centralized entry point for handling requests and responses, aligning well with the system's need to manage HTTP/REST traffic effectively.

**Decision Drivers:**
- The system must implement a Gateway component to manage HTTP/REST requests.

**Main Decision:** The chosen design decision is to utilize the Gateway Pattern for implementing a Gateway component in the new microservices architecture. This pattern offers a centralized entry point for managing HTTP/REST requests, ensuring streamlined request handling, improved security, and easier monitoring. The Gateway Pattern aligns perfectly with the system's requirement for managing HTTP/REST traffic and provides essential benefits for the overall architecture.

**Alternatives:**
1. API Gateway Pattern: This alternative also provides a centralized entry point for managing HTTP/REST requests, simplifying request routing and composition. However, it introduces a single point of failure and potential latency issues due to an additional layer.

**Pros:**
- Gateway Pattern:
  - Centralized management of HTTP/REST requests.
  - Improved security through centralized handling.
  - Easier monitoring and troubleshooting.
- API Gateway Pattern:
  - Simplifies request routing and composition.
  - Provides protocol translation.
  - Enables rate limiting and security features.

**Cons:**
- Gateway Pattern:
  - Potential single point of failure.
  - Risk of performance bottlenecks.
- API Gateway Pattern:
  - Adds a single point of failure.
  - May introduce latency due to an additional layer.

*Assessment:*
- Clarifying questions: Addressed concerns about authentication, authorization, high availability, and scalability.
- Assumptions and constraints: Considered well-segmented microservices and effective handling of traffic volume.
- Consequences on quality attributes: Enhanced scalability and security but introduced a single point of failure.
- Risks and tradeoffs: Identified risks of complexity, potential bottlenecks, and overloading under high traffic loads.
- Follow-up decisions: Defined routing rules, API composition strategy, and monitoring mechanisms for effective performance tracking.
