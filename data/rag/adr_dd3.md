# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Utilizing the Strategy Pattern for Delivery and Order Routing Optimization

## Motivation
The current system requires a module to optimize delivery and order routing based on delay, necessitating the implementation of two optimization algorithms. To address this requirement effectively, the Strategy Pattern is chosen to encapsulate these algorithms as strategies, enabling runtime switching between them and promoting flexibility and code reuse. This decision aligns with the transition to a microservices architecture and the need for independent variation of routing strategies.

## Decision Drivers
1. Provide a module for optimizing delivery and order routing based on delay.
2. Implement two optimization algorithms for assigning the best route.

## Main Decision
The main decision is to employ the Strategy Pattern for optimizing delivery and order routing. By encapsulating the optimization algorithms as strategies, the system can easily switch between the two algorithms at runtime. This approach promotes flexibility, code reuse, and independent variation of routing strategies based on delay. The Strategy Pattern aligns well with the requirements and the transition to a microservices architecture.

The Strategy Pattern allows for the creation of different algorithms as separate strategies, ensuring that changes in one algorithm do not affect others. This design decision enables the system to scale efficiently as new routing strategies are introduced. Additionally, the Strategy Pattern simplifies testing and maintenance by isolating the implementation details of each algorithm.

## Alternatives
1. Factory Method Pattern:
   - **Pros:** Allows client code to work with objects without knowing their concrete classes. Supports the Open/Closed Principle by enabling the addition of new object types without modifying existing code.
   - **Cons:** May lead to a large number of subclasses if many different types of objects need to be created. Potential complexity in managing multiple subclasses for different optimization algorithms.
