# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Architecture for Incidents Module

## Motivation
The current system of the food company needs to transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices to improve scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. One of the requirements is to provide a module to collect and report incidents. By adopting a microservices architecture, we can create a dedicated Incidents microservice that can handle this functionality independently, interact with other microservices, and evolve without impacting other parts of the system.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must provide a module to collect and report incidents.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement a Microservices pattern for the Incidents module. This decision involves creating a dedicated Incidents microservice that can independently handle the collection and reporting of incidents. This microservice will interact with other microservices like Customers, Orders, and Statistics to gather relevant data for reporting incidents. The loosely coupled nature of microservices allows the Incidents module to evolve independently without affecting other parts of the system. This decision aligns with the company's transition to a microservices architecture and ensures the scalability and maintainability of the system.

## Alternatives
1. **CQRS Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Improves performance by optimizing read and write operations separately, scales well with microservices architecture.
   - *Cons*: Introduces complexity with maintaining separate models for read and write operations.
   
2. **Event Sourcing Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Provides a full audit log of changes, enables rebuilding state at any point in time.
   - *Cons*: Increases complexity due to managing event streams and replaying events.

## Pros
### Microservices Architecture
- Enables the creation of a dedicated Incidents microservice.
- Allows for independent evolution of the Incidents module.
- Facilitates interaction with other microservices for data gathering.

### CQRS Pattern
- Improves performance by optimizing read and write operations separately.
- Scales well with microservices architecture.

### Event Sourcing Pattern
- Provides a full audit log of changes.
- Enables rebuilding state at any point in time.

## Cons
### Microservices Architecture
- Requires additional effort for setting up and managing microservices.

### CQRS Pattern
- Introduces complexity with maintaining separate models for read and write operations.

### Event Sourcing Pattern
- Increases complexity due to managing event streams and replaying events.
