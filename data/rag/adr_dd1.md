# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Pattern with Gateway Implementation

## Motivation
The food company aims to transition from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to achieve scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment. The existing data stored in SQL databases (Customers, Orders) needs to be effectively integrated into the new architecture. Additionally, the application must support HTTP/REST requests through a Gateway component and work seamlessly for both PC and mobile clients.

## Decision Drivers
1. Migrate from monolithic architecture to microservices.
2. Implement a Gateway component for managing HTTP/REST requests.
3. Ensure the application works for both PC and mobile.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to adopt the Microservices Pattern with Gateway Implementation. By breaking down the monolithic system into smaller, independent services, the company can achieve scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment. The Gateway component will manage HTTP/REST requests, providing a centralized entry point for clients accessing the microservices. This setup aligns with the requirements of transitioning to microservices, implementing a Gateway component, and supporting both PC and mobile clients.

The Microservices Pattern allows for independent scaling of services, technology diversity within services, and resilience to failures. The Gateway Implementation ensures centralized request management and facilitates communication between clients and microservices.

## Alternatives
1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - *Pros*: Simplicity in deployment and management.
   - *Cons*: Lack of scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment.

2. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
   - *Pros*: Loose coupling between services.
   - *Cons*: Heavier communication protocols, less flexibility compared to microservices.

## Pros
### Microservices Pattern with Gateway Implementation
- Scalability: Allows independent scaling of services.
- Flexibility: Enables technology diversity within services.
- Centralized Entry Point: Gateway provides a single access point for clients.
- Resilience: Failure in one service does not affect the entire system.

### Monolithic Architecture
- Simplicity: Easier deployment and management.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Loose Coupling: Services are decoupled.

## Cons
### Microservices Pattern with Gateway Implementation
- Complexity: Managing multiple services can be complex.
- Communication Overhead: Inter-service communication can introduce latency.

### Monolithic Architecture
- Lack of Scalability: Unable to scale independently.
- Limited Flexibility: Technology diversity is restricted.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Heavier Communication Protocols: May impact performance.
- Less Flexibility: Not as flexible as microservices.
