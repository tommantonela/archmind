# Title
Implementing Retry Pattern for Client Order Placement Attempts

# Motivation
The current system transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices requires a solution to enforce a maximum number of attempts for clients placing orders. This requirement ensures fault tolerance and resilience to transient failures in the order placement process.

# Decision Drivers
- Clients must have a maximum number of attempts to place an order.

# Main Decision
Utilize the Retry Pattern to enforce a maximum number of attempts for clients placing orders. By implementing the Retry Pattern, the system can provide fault tolerance and resilience to transient failures, ensuring that clients are allowed a specified number of attempts to place an order.

# Alternatives
No other alternatives considered.

# Pros
- Ensures fault tolerance and resilience to transient failures.
- Provides a clear mechanism for handling client order placement attempts.

# Cons
- Requires additional implementation effort to integrate the Retry Pattern.
