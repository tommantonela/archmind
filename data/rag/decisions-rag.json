This pattern aligns perfectly with the requirement to migrate from a monolithic architecture to microservices. It allows breaking down the system into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. Additionally, the use of a Gateway component for managing HTTP/REST requests fits well within the microservices architecture. Moreover, microservices can be designed to be device-agnostic, making them suitable for both PC and mobile devices. By implementing the Microservices pattern, the food company can effectively transition to a more scalable and flexible architecture while meeting the specified requirements.",
