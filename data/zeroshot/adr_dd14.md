# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
Microservices Architecture for Payments Module

## Motivation
The food company is transitioning from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to improve modularity and scalability. One of the critical business requirements is to provide a module to manage payments. By adopting the Microservices Architecture pattern, we can create a dedicated Payments service within the microservices ecosystem, ensuring independent development, modularity, and scalability. This decision aligns with the company's goal of transitioning to a more flexible and scalable architecture.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must provide a module to manage payments.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement the Microservices Architecture pattern. This pattern decomposes the system into smaller, independent services, allowing the creation of a dedicated Payments service within the microservices ecosystem. The Payments service can handle all payment-related functionalities independently, ensuring modularity and scalability. The OrderManager component will be able to communicate seamlessly with the Payments service as part of the overall microservices architecture.

The decision addresses the requirement by providing a dedicated service for managing payments, ensuring that payment-related functionalities are encapsulated within a separate service. This approach enhances modularity, scalability, and independence of the Payments module within the system.

## Alternatives
1. RESTful Web Services pattern
2. Gateway Pattern
3. Database per Service pattern

## Pros
### Microservices Architecture pattern
- Scalability: Independent services can be scaled individually based on demand.
- Flexibility: Easier to develop and deploy new features independently.
- Independent Development: Each service can be developed and maintained separately.

### RESTful Web Services pattern
- Interoperability: Standard way of accessing resources using HTTP methods.
- Scalability: Can handle a large number of concurrent requests.
- Caching: Ability to cache responses for improved performance.

### Gateway Pattern
- Centralized Access Control: Provides a single entry point for client requests.
- Protocol Translation: Can handle various protocols and translate them as needed.

### Database per Service pattern
- Autonomy: Each service has its dedicated database for autonomy.
- Data Isolation: Ensures data isolation between services.
- Independent Scaling: Services can scale independently based on their database needs.

## Cons
### Microservices Architecture pattern
- Complexity: Managing a distributed system can introduce complexity.
- Distributed System Challenges: Requires robust communication protocols and error handling.

### RESTful Web Services pattern
- Overhead: Additional overhead due to HTTP communication.
- Security Vulnerabilities: Potential security risks associated with web services.

### Gateway Pattern
- Single Point of Failure: The gateway can become a bottleneck or a single point of failure.

### Database per Service pattern
- Data Duplication: May lead to data duplication across services.
- Consistency Challenges: Ensuring data consistency between services can be challenging.

This ADR outlines the decision to adopt the Microservices Architecture pattern to address the requirement of providing a module to manage payments within the new architecture.
