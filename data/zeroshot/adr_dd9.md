# Title
Implementing Event Sourcing Pattern for Incident Tracking and Reporting

## Motivation
The system needs to provide a module to collect and report incidents. To achieve this, it is crucial to have a comprehensive audit log of changes for incident tracking and reporting purposes. The Event Sourcing pattern captures all changes as events, enabling easy tracking of incidents, analysis of causes, and generation of reports based on the event history.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must provide a module to collect and report incidents.

## Main Decision
Implement the Event Sourcing pattern to collect and report incidents. By utilizing Event Sourcing, the system can maintain a detailed audit log of changes, facilitating incident tracking, cause analysis, and report generation based on historical events. This pattern aligns well with the requirement for incident reporting and ensures a robust mechanism for managing incidents within the system.

## Alternatives
1. Microservices Pattern:
Decomposes the system into smaller, independent services for scalability and flexibility.
Pros: Scalability, flexibility, independent deployment
Cons: Complexity, increased network communication

2. Event Sourcing Pattern (Not Chosen):
Stores the state of the system as a sequence of events for auditability and scalability.
Pros: Auditability, scalability, event-driven architecture
Cons: Complexity, increased storage requirements

## Pros
- Comprehensive audit log of changes for incident tracking and reporting
- Facilitates easy tracking of incidents and cause analysis
- Enables generation of reports based on historical events

## Cons
- Potential complexity in implementing the Event Sourcing pattern
- Increased storage requirements compared to other alternatives
