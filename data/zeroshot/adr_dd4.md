# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Utilizing the Strategy Pattern for optimizing delivery and order routing algorithms

## Motivation
The system needs to provide a module to optimize delivery and order routing based on delay, requiring the implementation of two optimization algorithms. By selecting the Strategy Pattern, we aim to encapsulate these algorithms, allowing for easy swapping between them at runtime. This decision promotes flexibility and maintainability within the system, aligning with the transition to a microservices architecture and the need for modular, interchangeable components.

## Decision Drivers
1. Provide a module to optimize delivery and order routing based on delay.
2. Implement two optimization algorithms for route assignment.
3. Promote flexibility and maintainability in the system.

## Main Decision
The main decision is to employ the Strategy Pattern for optimizing delivery and order routing with different algorithms. By encapsulating the algorithms within separate classes and making them interchangeable, the Strategy Pattern enables the system to easily switch between the two optimization algorithms based on delay. This approach enhances flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility, aligning with the requirements of the system and the goals of the microservices architecture transition.

Integrating the Strategy Pattern into the existing microservices architecture will involve defining interfaces for the Strategy Pattern and the optimization algorithms. Specific criteria for determining when to switch between the two algorithms based on delay need to be established. Assumptions include the clean encapsulation of the algorithms and the validity of switching based on delay. Risks include potential complexity in managing multiple algorithms and the overhead of implementing the Strategy Pattern. Trade-offs may involve increased development effort for the initial implementation.

## Alternatives
1. Factory Method Pattern: This alternative defines an interface for creating objects but may lead to a proliferation of subclasses and complexity in maintenance.
2. Chain of Responsibility Pattern: This alternative avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver but may cause issues if not properly configured and can be difficult to debug.

## Pros
- Strategy Pattern:
  - Promotes flexibility by allowing the selection of an algorithm at runtime.
  - Enables easy addition of new algorithms without changing the context.
- Factory Method Pattern:
  - Promotes loose coupling between the creator and the product.
  - Allows subclasses to provide an extended version of an object.
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
  - Decouples senders and receivers.
  - Allows multiple objects to handle the request without specifying the receiver explicitly.

## Cons
- Strategy Pattern:
  - May introduce complexity by increasing the number of classes and interfaces.
- Factory Method Pattern:
  - May lead to a proliferation of subclasses.
  - Can be complex to maintain.
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
  - May cause issues if the chain is not properly configured.
  - Can be difficult to debug.
