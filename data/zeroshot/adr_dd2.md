# Title
Retry Pattern for Managing Customer Orders

## Motivation
The system needs to manage customer orders efficiently, including retrying failed requests within a maximum number of attempts to ensure reliability. By implementing the Retry Pattern, the system can address this requirement effectively.

## Decision Drivers
1. Provide a module to manage customer orders.
2. Limit the number of attempts for clients to place an order.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement the Retry Pattern for managing customer orders. This pattern will allow the system to automatically retry failed requests within a specified number of attempts, ensuring that clients have a limited number of chances to place an order. By incorporating the Retry Pattern, the system can enhance reliability and provide a seamless user experience for order management.

## Alternatives
1. RESTful Web Services pattern
2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern
3. Microservices Architecture pattern
4. Gateway Pattern
5. Database per Service pattern
6. Service Discovery pattern
7. Circuit Breaker Pattern

## Pros
### Retry Pattern
- Improved reliability
- Increased fault tolerance
- Seamless user experience

### Alternatives
1. RESTful Web Services pattern
- Standardized communication
- Scalability
2. CQRS pattern
- Performance optimization
- Scalability
3. Microservices Architecture pattern
- Scalability
- Flexibility in technology stack
4. Gateway Pattern
- Centralized access point
- Load balancing
5. Database per Service pattern
- Data autonomy
- Independent scaling
6. Service Discovery pattern
- Dynamic service updates
- Load balancing
7. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Fault tolerance
- Resilience

## Cons
### Retry Pattern
- Potential for infinite loops
- Increased load on services

### Alternatives
1. RESTful Web Services pattern
- Overhead in HTTP communication
- Security concerns
2. CQRS pattern
- Complexity in implementation
- Eventual consistency challenges
3. Microservices Architecture pattern
- Increased complexity in deployment
- Communication overhead between services
4. Gateway Pattern
- Single point of failure
- Potential performance bottleneck
5. Database per Service pattern
- Data consistency challenges
- Increased resource consumption
6. Service Discovery pattern
- Complexity in implementation
- Dependency on discovery mechanism
7. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Added complexity in handling failures
- Delay in detecting service recovery
