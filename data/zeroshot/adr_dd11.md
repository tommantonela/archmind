# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Architecture for Statistics Module

## Motivation
The food company is transitioning to a microservices architecture to replace the existing monolithic system. The system must include a module to provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers. By adopting the Microservices Architecture pattern, we can create a dedicated Statistics service that can independently provide statistics on different domains. This approach aligns with the company's business logic and allows for efficient data retrieval and processing for statistics generation.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must include a module to provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers.

## Main Decision
The main decision is to implement the Microservices Architecture pattern. This decision allows for the creation of a dedicated Statistics service within the microservices ecosystem. Each microservice can focus on a specific domain, enabling efficient data retrieval and processing for generating statistics on orders, trucks, and customers. This approach supports scalability, flexibility in development, and independent deployment of services, aligning well with the company's transition to a microservices architecture.

Considering the assessment, clarifying questions about data sharing and consistency mechanisms will need to be addressed during the design and implementation phases. Assumptions and constraints include effective communication and data sharing among microservices, with a focus on robust error handling and data synchronization mechanisms. The decision positively impacts modifiability and scalability but may introduce performance challenges if data sharing and synchronization are not optimized. Risks involve increased complexity in data sharing and synchronization, with a trade-off between modularity and inter-service communication overhead. Follow-up decisions will involve designing data sharing mechanisms and implementing error handling and data synchronization strategies.

## Alternatives
1. HTTP/REST API pattern: This alternative simplifies communication between services but may introduce overhead in data serialization/deserialization and security concerns with public APIs.
2. Microservices Architecture pattern: The chosen decision provides scalability and flexibility in development but may lead to increased complexity in managing distributed systems and communication overhead between services.

## Pros
- Microservices Architecture:
  - Scalability and flexibility in development
  - Independent deployment of services
- HTTP/REST API pattern:
  - Simplifies communication between services
  - Supports stateless communication

## Cons
- Microservices Architecture:
  - Increased complexity in managing distributed systems
  - Communication overhead between services
- HTTP/REST API pattern:
  - Overhead in serializing and deserializing data
  - Security concerns with public APIs
