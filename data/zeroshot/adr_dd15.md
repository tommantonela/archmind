# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Utilizing the Repository Pattern for Data Access in the Microservices Architecture

## Motivation
The transition from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture at the food company necessitates a structured approach to handle data access and manipulation. The need to create, modify, update, and process orders in the system requires a solution that can efficiently manage these operations within the microservices environment. The Repository Pattern provides a suitable mechanism to separate data access logic, aligning well with the requirements and ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Decision Drivers
- It must be possible to create orders, modify them, update their data, and process them.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement the Repository Pattern for data access in the microservices architecture. The Repository Pattern will encapsulate the data access logic for orders, providing a clear separation between data access and business logic. This separation will enable efficient management and maintenance of order operations within the microservices environment. The Repository Pattern aligns with the need to handle data access in a structured manner, ensuring that order-related functionalities can be effectively implemented and maintained.

The Repository Pattern will interact with the existing SQL databases for Orders and Customers by abstracting the data access operations, allowing the microservices to interact with the databases through the defined repository interfaces. The OrderManager component will coordinate with the Repository Pattern for order operations, delegating data access tasks to the repositories.

Assumptions and constraints: The decision assumes that the data access requirements for orders align with the capabilities of the Repository Pattern. Constraints may arise if the existing data structure does not fit well with the pattern.

Consequences on quality attributes: The Repository Pattern can enhance maintainability and scalability by providing a structured approach to data access. It can improve data consistency and reduce duplication. However, it may introduce latency due to additional layers of abstraction and could impact performance if not implemented efficiently.

Risks and tradeoffs: Risks include potential complexity in managing interactions between the Repository Pattern and existing databases. Trade-offs may involve increased development effort to implement the pattern effectively.

Follow-up decisions: 
1. Define the interfaces between the Repository Pattern and the microservices.
2. Determine the mapping between the existing data schema and the Repository Pattern structure.

## Alternatives
1. Command Pattern
   - Pros:
     1. Encapsulates requests related to orders
     2. Allows for parameterization of commands for orders
   - Cons:
     1. Can lead to a large number of command classes
     2. May introduce overhead in managing commands

2. Event-Driven Architecture pattern
   - Pros:
     1. Supports asynchronous processing of order-related events
     2. Enables decoupling of components through event-driven communication
   - Cons:
     1. May introduce complexity in event handling
     2. Requires careful design to ensure event consistency

## Pros
- Repository Pattern:
  - Encapsulates the data access logic for orders
  - Provides a clear separation between data access and business logic

## Cons
- Repository Pattern:
  - Can introduce additional complexity in the system
  - May require additional effort to implement
