# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Utilizing the Strategy Pattern for Optimizing Delivery and Order Routing

## Motivation
The system needs to provide a module for optimizing delivery and order routing based on delay, implementing two optimization algorithms. By encapsulating these algorithms as strategies, the system can easily switch between them at runtime, promoting flexibility and code reuse. This approach aligns with the company's transition to a microservices architecture and the need for appropriate software elements to support key functionalities.

## Decision Drivers
1. Optimize delivery and order routing based on delay.
2. Implement two optimization algorithms for routing.
3. Promote flexibility and code reuse.
4. Support the transition to a microservices architecture.

## Main Decision
The main decision is to utilize the Strategy Pattern for optimizing delivery and order routing with different algorithms. By encapsulating the optimization algorithms as strategies, the system can easily switch between the two algorithms at runtime, promoting flexibility and code reuse. This pattern allows for the independent variation of algorithms, making it suitable for implementing multiple routing strategies based on delay.

Integrating the Strategy Pattern with the existing microservices architecture and the OrderManager component will involve defining clear interfaces for the strategies and ensuring seamless communication between the strategies and the OrderManager. Specific criteria for switching between the two optimization algorithms at runtime should be established based on factors such as current traffic conditions, delivery delays, or other relevant metrics.

## Alternatives
1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
2. Factory Method Pattern

## Pros
### Strategy Pattern
- Promotes code reuse
- Allows for easy algorithm swapping
- Provides a clear separation of concerns between the context and the algorithms

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Decouples senders and receivers of requests
- Allows adding or modifying handlers dynamically
- Provides flexibility in handling requests

### Factory Method Pattern
- Promotes loose coupling between the creator and the product
- Allows for easy extension by adding new subclasses
- Supports the creation of objects without specifying the exact class

## Cons
### Strategy Pattern
- May introduce additional complexity with multiple strategies
- Requires careful design to avoid excessive class proliferation

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Can lead to issues if the chain is not properly configured
- May become too long, causing potential performance issues

### Factory Method Pattern
- Can lead to a proliferation of subclasses if not carefully managed
- Requires subclasses to decide which class to instantiate, potentially leading to confusion
