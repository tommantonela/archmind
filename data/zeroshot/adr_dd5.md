# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Architecture Decision for Managing Client Personal Data and Orders

## Motivation
The company is transitioning from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to enhance scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. The system must manage client personal data, order data, and order processing efficiently. The Microservices pattern aligns with the company's plan and can address the specified requirements effectively.

## Decision Drivers
1. Manage client personal data
2. Access order data
3. Create, modify, update, and process orders

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement the Microservices pattern. By decomposing the system into smaller, independent services, each dedicated to a specific domain (e.g., Customers, Orders), the system can efficiently manage client personal data, order data, and order processing. This approach allows for the creation of dedicated services for each functionality, ensuring the system fulfills all requirements effectively.

The Microservices pattern enhances scalability, flexibility in technology stack, and isolation of failures. It enables independent deployment of services and aligns with the company's transition plan. However, it introduces complexity in managing distributed systems and potential latency due to network communication.

## Alternatives
1. **CQRS Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Scalability, performance optimization, simplified queries
   - *Cons*: Complexity, eventual consistency challenges

2. **RESTful API Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Standardized communication, platform-independent, caching support
   - *Cons*: Limited functionality, overhead in data transfer

3. **Gateway Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Centralized access control, load balancing, security enforcement
   - *Cons*: Single point of failure, increased latency

4. **Database per Service Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Data autonomy, independent schema evolution, performance optimization
   - *Cons*: Data duplication, data consistency challenges

5. **HTTP/REST API Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Stateless interactions, cacheability, uniform interfaces
   - *Cons*: Lack of discoverability, limited functionality

6. **Microservices Architecture Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Independent deployment, technology diversity, scalability
   - *Cons*: Increased operational complexity, service discovery challenges

7. **Repository Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Separation of concerns, centralized data access, testability
   - *Cons*: Overhead in implementation, potential performance impact

8. **Command Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Decoupling of sender and receiver, undo/redo operations, extensibility
   - *Cons*: Increased number of classes, complex to implement

9. **Event-Driven Architecture Pattern**
   - *Pros*: Loose coupling, scalability, asynchronous communication
   - *Cons*: Eventual consistency challenges, debugging complexity

## Pros
- **Microservices Pattern**:
  - Enhances scalability
  - Provides flexibility in technology stack
  - Enables isolation of failures

## Cons
- **Microservices Pattern**:
  - Introduces distributed system complexity
  - Increases communication overhead

## Notes
- Clarifying questions: 
  1. How will the microservices communicate with the existing SQL databases for Customers and Orders?
  2. What strategies will be in place to ensure data consistency and integrity across the microservices?
  3. How will the Gateway component handle the routing of requests to the appropriate microservices?
- Assumptions and constraints:
  - Assumes the company has the necessary resources and expertise for the transition.
  - Assumes smooth data migration without significant loss.
- Consequences on quality attributes:
  - Enhances scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.
  - Improves fault isolation and independent deployment.
  - Introduces latency and complexity in managing distributed systems.
- Risks and tradeoffs:
  - Risks include increased complexity in development and operations.
  - Trade-offs involve higher overhead compared to a monolithic system.
- Follow-up decisions:
  1. Design communication protocols between microservices and the Gateway component.
  2. Implement data synchronization mechanisms with SQL databases.
  3. Define monitoring and logging strategies for the microservices architecture.
