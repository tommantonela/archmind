# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Utilizing Microservices Pattern for Incidents Module

## Motivation
The current system transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices requires the implementation of a dedicated Incidents module. This module must collect and report incidents independently without impacting other critical and non-critical modules. The microservices architecture provides the necessary flexibility and scalability to achieve this requirement while maintaining the system's modularity.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must provide a module to collect and report incidents.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement the Microservices pattern for the Incidents module. By structuring the system as a collection of loosely coupled services, a dedicated Incidents microservice can be created. This microservice will interact with other microservices like Customers, Orders, and Statistics to gather relevant data for reporting incidents. The independent evolution of the Incidents module is facilitated by the loosely coupled nature of microservices, ensuring that changes in this module do not impact other parts of the system.

The decision addresses the requirement by enabling the creation of a dedicated Incidents microservice that can handle incident collection and reporting independently. It leverages the flexibility and scalability of microservices to ensure that the Incidents module can evolve autonomously without affecting critical functionalities.

## Alternatives
1. Event Sourcing Pattern:
   - **Pros:** Provides a full audit trail and history of changes.
   - **Cons:** Complexity in implementation and maintenance.

## Pros
- **Microservices Pattern:**
  - Scalability and flexibility in handling incident data.
  - Independent deployment and evolution of the Incidents module.

- **Event Sourcing Pattern:**
  - Provides a full audit trail and history of changes.

## Cons
- **Microservices Pattern:**
  - Increased complexity in deployment and monitoring.
  - Challenges in ensuring consistent data access and managing inter-service communication.

- **Event Sourcing Pattern:**
  - Complexity in implementation and maintenance.

This ADR outlines the decision to adopt the Microservices pattern for the Incidents module, considering the system context, requirements, and assessment provided.
