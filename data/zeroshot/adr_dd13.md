# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Pattern with Gateway Integration

## Motivation
The current system of the food company is a monolithic architecture that needs to be transitioned to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, flexibility, and independent development. The migration requires the implementation of a Gateway component to manage HTTP/REST requests efficiently. Additionally, the application must be accessible from both PC and mobile devices.

## Decision Drivers
1. Migrate from monolithic architecture to microservices.
2. Implement a Gateway component for managing HTTP/REST requests.
3. Ensure application accessibility for both PC and mobile.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to adopt the Microservices Pattern with Gateway Integration. By decomposing the application into smaller services, the Microservices Pattern allows for independent development and scalability. The Gateway Pattern will be implemented alongside to manage HTTP/REST requests efficiently, providing a centralized access point for clients accessing the microservices. This decision aligns with the requirements of transitioning to microservices, implementing a Gateway component, and ensuring cross-device accessibility.

The integration of the Gateway Pattern with the Microservices Pattern will enable a centralized and secure access point for clients, simplifying communication and enhancing security. The Microservices Pattern will improve scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment of services, while the Gateway Pattern will streamline HTTP/REST request management.

## Alternatives
1. **Gateway Pattern**
   - Pros:
     - Simplifies communication between clients and services
     - Provides a single entry point for all requests
     - Enhances security by centralizing access control
   - Cons:
     - Single point of failure
     - Can introduce latency if not properly optimized

2. **Client-Server Pattern**
   - Pros:
     - Clear separation of concerns between client and server
     - Scalability by adding more servers
     - Easy to implement and understand
   - Cons:
     - Can lead to tight coupling between client and server
     - Limited scalability compared to microservices
