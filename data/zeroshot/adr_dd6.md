# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Implementing Gateway Pattern for Managing HTTP/REST Requests in Microservices Architecture

## Motivation
The transition from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture at the food company necessitates the implementation of a Gateway component to manage HTTP/REST requests. This decision aligns with the company's need to centralize request handling, improve security, and enable easier monitoring in the new architecture.

## Decision Drivers
- The system must implement a Gateway component to manage HTTP/REST requests.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to implement the Gateway Pattern for managing HTTP/REST requests in the microservices architecture. The Gateway Pattern provides a centralized entry point for handling requests and responses, simplifying communication between clients and microservices. It addresses the requirement for managing HTTP/REST traffic effectively by offering centralized management, improved security, and easier monitoring. This decision aligns well with the system's needs for transitioning to a microservices architecture.

The Gateway Pattern can positively impact system quality attributes such as security, scalability, and maintainability. It enhances security by providing a centralized point for implementing security measures, improves scalability through centralized management and routing capabilities, and enhances maintainability by separating concerns and enabling easier monitoring.

Assumptions and constraints include the effective integration of the Gateway Pattern into the microservices architecture without significant complexity. Thorough testing and validation of the Gateway component's interactions with the microservices will be necessary to ensure its reliability and fault tolerance.

## Alternatives
No other design decisions were considered as the Gateway Pattern best addresses the requirements and system context provided.

## Pros
- Simplifies communication between clients and microservices
- Provides a single entry point for all requests
- Enables centralized security and monitoring
- Enhances security, scalability, and maintainability of the system

## Cons
- Can introduce a single point of failure
- May become a bottleneck for high traffic systems
