# Architecture Decision Record

## Title
Microservices Pattern with Gateway Component for Transitioning to Microservices Architecture

## Motivation
The company aims to transition from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture to achieve scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment. This transition involves replacing current access methods with HTTP/REST protocols through a Gateway component. Additionally, the application needs to cater to both PC and mobile clients.

## Decision Drivers
1. Migrate from monolithic architecture to microservices.
2. Implement a Gateway component to manage HTTP/REST requests.
3. Ensure the application works for both PC and mobile.

## Main Decision
The chosen design decision is to adopt the Microservices Pattern with a Gateway Component. By breaking down the monolithic system into smaller, independent services, the company can achieve scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment. The Gateway Component will manage HTTP/REST requests, providing a centralized entry point for clients accessing the microservices. This setup aligns with the requirements of transitioning to microservices architecture and supporting both PC and mobile clients.

The decision addresses the need for scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment by leveraging the benefits of microservices architecture. The Gateway Component ensures centralized management of HTTP/REST requests, simplifying communication between clients and services. Working for both PC and mobile clients is facilitated through the Gateway Component's handling of incoming requests.

## Alternatives
1. Gateway Pattern:
   - Centralized component managing all incoming and outgoing requests.
   - Pros: Simplifies communication, provides a single entry point.
   - Cons: Single point of failure, potential performance bottleneck.

2. Microservices Pattern:
   - Architectural style composed of small, independent services.
   - Pros: Scalability, flexibility, technology diversity.
   - Cons: Complexity in managing multiple services, increased network communication overhead.
