The Customer Database contains customer and payment data, while the Order Database is responsible for storing the remaining data. The current access is intended to be replaced by HTTP/REST protocols by means of an appropriate Gateway component. \\nThe company's business logic has the following modules: \\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2  Customers (Critical): This component allows you to access customers' personal data. \\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2  Orders (non-critical): This module allows customers to place orders for products from the company. If a customer attempts to place an order, they are allowed a number of attempts to determine. \\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2  Delivery & Routing (Critical): This complex component has a lot of functionality that needs to be decoupled and manages the delivery of transport fleets to customers and truck routes. The management has 2 optimization algorithms that are selected based on the truck's delay. \\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a2  Statistics (non-critical): The system has a statistics module that provides valuable information on the status of orders and the real-time status of trucks.
