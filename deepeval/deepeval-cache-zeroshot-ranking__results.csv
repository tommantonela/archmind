The need to create, modify, update, and process orders in the system requires a solution that can efficiently manage these operations within the microservices environment. The Repository Pattern provides a suitable mechanism to separate data access logic, aligning well with the requirements and ensuring maintainability and scalability.\nDecision Drivers\n\nIt must be possible to create orders, modify them, update their data, and process them.\n\nMain Decision\nThe chosen design decision is to implement the Repository Pattern for data access in the microservices architecture. The Repository Pattern will encapsulate the data access logic for orders, providing a clear separation between data access and business logic. This separation will enable efficient management and maintenance of order operations within the microservices environment. The Repository Pattern aligns with the need to handle data access in a structured manner, ensuring that order-related functionalities can be effectively implemented and maintained.\nThe Repository Pattern will interact with the existing SQL databases for Orders and Customers by abstracting the data access operations, allowing the microservices to interact with the databases through the defined repository interfaces. The OrderManager component will coordinate with the Repository Pattern for order operations, delegating data access tasks to the repositories.\nAssumptions and constraints: The decision assumes that the data access requirements for orders align with the capabilities of the Repository Pattern. Constraints may arise if the existing data structure does not fit well with the pattern.\nConsequences on quality attributes: The Repository Pattern can enhance maintainability and scalability by providing a structured approach to data access. It can improve data consistency and reduce duplication. However, it may introduce latency due to additional layers of abstraction and could impact performance if not implemented efficiently.\nRisks and tradeoffs: Risks include potential complexity in managing interactions between the Repository Pattern and existing databases.
