The system must include a module to provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers.

This approach aligns with the company's business logic and allows for efficient data retrieval and processing for statistics generation.\nDecision Drivers\n\nThe system must include a module to provide statistics on orders, trucks, and customers.\n\nMain Decision\nThe main decision is to implement the Microservices Architecture pattern. This decision allows for the creation of a dedicated Statistics service within the microservices ecosystem. Each microservice can focus on a specific domain, enabling efficient data retrieval and processing for generating statistics on orders, trucks, and customers. This approach supports scalability, flexibility in development, and independent deployment of services, aligning well with the company's transition to a microservices architecture.\nConsidering the assessment, clarifying questions about data sharing and consistency mechanisms will need to be addressed during the design and implementation phases. Assumptions and constraints include effective communication and data sharing among microservices, with a focus on robust error handling and data synchronization mechanisms. The decision positively impacts modifiability and scalability but may introduce performance challenges if data sharing and synchronization are not optimized. Risks involve increased complexity in data sharing and synchronization, with a trade-off between modularity and inter-service communication overhead. Follow-up decisions will involve designing data sharing mechanisms and implementing error handling and data synchronization strategies.\nAlternatives\n\nHTTP/REST API pattern: This alternative simplifies communication between services but may introduce overhead in data serialization/deserialization and security concerns with public APIs.\nMicroservices Architecture pattern: The chosen decision provides scalability and flexibility in development but may lead to increased complexity in managing distributed systems and communication overhead between services.\n\nPros\n\nMicroservices Architecture:\nScalability and flexibility in development\nIndependent deployment of services\nHTTP/REST API pattern:\nSimplifies communication between services\nSupports stateless communication\n\nCons\n\nMicroservices Architecture:\nIncreased complexity in managing distributed systems\nCommunication overhead between services\nHTTP/REST API pattern:\nOverhead in serializing and deserializing data\nSecurity concerns with public APIs\n"", ""context"": null, ""expected_output"": ""Statistics Component\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2023-11-07\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nWe need to create a statistics module that allows us to provide information about the status of orders and the real-time situation of trucks.\nDecision Drivers\n\nRF05: Statistics module.\n\nConsidered Options\n\n0011-1-Apache Common Maths Component\n0011-2-Implement a Class\n\nDecision Outcome\nChosen option: \""0011-1-Apache Common Maths Component\"", because it is easier to design and thus solves the problem.\nPositive Consequences\n\nEasy to design.\nSimpler solution.\n\nNegative Consequences\n\nRequires installation of the library and Apache Maven.\n\nPros of the Options\n0011-1-Apache Common Maths Component\nApache Common Maths is a library that allows statistical calculations.\n\nCompatible with Java.\nSelf-contained.\nLightweight.\n\n0011-2-Implement a Class\nCreate a class that implements all statistical operations.\n\nWe can select which queries can be performed.\nNo need to install any external library.\n\nCons of the Options\n0011-1-Apache Common Maths Component\n\nRequires installation of Apache Maven as well.\n\n0011-2-Implement a Class\n\nMore complex to design and implement.\n"", ""hyperparameters"": null, ""input"": ""The context below describes the main characteristics and \n    operating enviroment for a software system that needs to be developed. \n    As part of the context, there is also a requirement that this software system must fulfill.\n    I made a main design decision that addresses the requirement. \n    For that decision, I might also have an assesment of its pros, cons, and risks, among other aspects.\n\n    Based on all this information, please specify an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for me.\n    The ADR template includes the following sections: 'title', 'motivation', 'decision', 'pros' of the decision, \n    'cons' of the decision, and 'alternatives' considered.\n    For writing the sections of the ADR, think step by step and use the following rules:\n    1.

The need to create, modify, update, and process orders in the system requires a solution that can efficiently manage these operations within the microservices environment. The Repository Pattern provides a suitable mechanism to separate data access logic, aligning well with the requirements and ensuring maintainability and scalability.\nDecision Drivers\n\nIt must be possible to create orders, modify them, update their data, and process them.\n\nMain Decision\nThe chosen design decision is to implement the Repository Pattern for data access in the microservices architecture. The Repository Pattern will encapsulate the data access logic for orders, providing a clear separation between data access and business logic. This separation will enable efficient management and maintenance of order operations within the microservices environment. The Repository Pattern aligns with the need to handle data access in a structured manner, ensuring that order-related functionalities can be effectively implemented and maintained.\nThe Repository Pattern will interact with the existing SQL databases for Orders and Customers by abstracting the data access operations, allowing the microservices to interact with the databases through the defined repository interfaces. The OrderManager component will coordinate with the Repository Pattern for order operations, delegating data access tasks to the repositories.\nAssumptions and constraints: The decision assumes that the data access requirements for orders align with the capabilities of the Repository Pattern. Constraints may arise if the existing data structure does not fit well with the pattern.\nConsequences on quality attributes: The Repository Pattern can enhance maintainability and scalability by providing a structured approach to data access. It can improve data consistency and reduce duplication. However, it may introduce latency due to additional layers of abstraction and could impact performance if not implemented efficiently.\nRisks and tradeoffs: Risks include potential complexity in managing interactions between the Repository Pattern and existing databases. Trade-offs may involve increased development effort to implement the pattern effectively.\nFollow-up decisions: \n1. Define the interfaces between the Repository Pattern and the microservices.\n2.
