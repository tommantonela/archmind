The system needs to manage client personal data, order data, and order processing efficiently. By adopting the Microservices pattern, the system can decompose into smaller, independent services, aligning with the company's plan and fulfilling the specified requirements effectively.\nDecision Drivers\n\nManage client personal data\nAccess to order data\nCreate, modify, update, and process orders\n\nMain Decision\nThe chosen design decision is to implement a Microservices architecture. By decomposing the system into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., Customers, Orders), the system can effectively manage client personal data, order data, and order processing. This approach aligns with the company's transition plan and enables the system to fulfill all specified requirements efficiently.\nThe Microservices pattern allows for the creation of dedicated services for managing client personal data, order data, and order processing. This separation of concerns ensures that each service can focus on its specific functionality, leading to better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

The Customer Database contains customer and payment data, while the Order Database is responsible for storing the remaining data. The current access is intended to be replaced by HTTP/REST protocols by means of an appropriate Gateway component. \nThe company's business logic has the following modules: \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Customers (Critical): This component allows you to access customers' personal data. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Orders (non-critical): This module allows customers to place orders for products from the company.

The current access is intended to be replaced by HTTP/REST protocols by means of an appropriate Gateway component. \nThe company's business logic has the following modules: \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Customers (Critical): This component allows you to access customers' personal data. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Orders (non-critical): This module allows customers to place orders for products from the company.

In that migration, a Gateway component has to be implmented to manage HTTP/REST requests.

This pattern aligns perfectly with the requirement to migrate from a monolithic architecture to microservices. It allows breaking down the system into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. Additionally, the use of a Gateway component for managing HTTP/REST requests fits well within the microservices architecture.

The existing architecture has a part of PC and mobile clients that access the company's data hosted in 2 SQL databases (Customers, Orders). The Customer Database contains customer and payment data, while the Order Database is responsible for storing the remaining data. The current access is intended to be replaced by HTTP/REST protocols by means of an appropriate Gateway component. \nThe company's business logic has the following modules: \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Customers (Critical): This component allows you to access customers' personal data. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Orders (non-critical): This module allows customers to place orders for products from the company. If a customer attempts to place an order, they are allowed a number of attempts to determine. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Delivery & Routing (Critical): This complex component has a lot of functionality that needs to be decoupled and manages the delivery of transport fleets to customers and truck routes. The management has 2 optimization algorithms that are selected based on the truck's delay. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Statistics (non-critical): The system has a statistics module that provides valuable information on the status of orders and the real-time status of trucks. Statistics also provide customer information. \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Incidents (semi-critical): This module reports to route managers any type of incident (broken down truck, delivery not made, etc.) \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2  Payments (critical): This component is an external payment gateway provided by another company to ensure the security of payments. \nThe new architecture must have the right software elements to run the microservices. On the other hand, in the architecture there is a component called OrderManager that acts as an intermediary between customers, orders, delivery and incidents, communicating these functionalities. \n\n\n    List of requirements:\n    The system must provide a module to optimize the functions for delivery and order routing depending on the expected delay. Two optimization algorithms to assign the best route should be implemented.\n\n    Decision: The Factory Method Pattern is the best pattern for the given requirements as it allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created, which is essential for implementing different optimization algorithms for delivery and order routing. By encapsulating object creation, it provides a flexible way to implement the two optimization algorithms required. The loose coupling promoted by this pattern aligns well with the transition to a microservices architecture and the need for modular optimization functions.\n\n    Ranking of alternatives (optional):\n    * pattern_name: Factory Method Pattern\n * description: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.\n * pros: Promotes loose coupling, allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created, encapsulates object creation, provides a hook for subclasses to provide an extended behavior\n * cons: Can lead to an explosion of subclasses if many products are required, may introduce complexity by adding an additional layer of abstraction\n\n    Assessment (optional):\n    appropriateness: appropriate\nclarifying_questions: 1. How will the Factory Method Pattern handle the communication between the different modules in the microservices architecture? 2. Are there specific criteria for selecting the optimization algorithms based on expected delay?\nassumptions_and_constraints: Assumes that the optimization algorithms can be encapsulated within subclasses effectively. Constraints may arise if the creation of subclasses for different algorithms leads to code duplication or maintenance overhead.\nqa_consequences: The Factory Method Pattern can enhance modifiability and extensibility by allowing easy addition of new optimization algorithms. It may positively impact maintainability by encapsulating object creation. However, it could introduce performance overhead if not implemented efficiently.\nrisks_and_tradeoffs: Risks include potential complexity in managing multiple subclasses for different algorithms. Trade-offs may involve increased development time for creating and maintaining subclasses. There is a risk of over-engineering if the Factory Method Pattern is applied unnecessarily.\nfollowup_decisions: 1. Define a clear interface for the Factory Method to ensure consistency in object creation. 2. Consider implementing a strategy for dynamically selecting the optimization algorithms based on runtime conditions.\ndecision: DD4\n\n    Task: Write an Architecture Decision Record based on the context, requirements, decision, and assessment provided.\n\n    Helpful Answer:"", ""model"": null, ""retrieval_context"": null, ""user_prompt_template"": null}"
